This source code is only for use by members of "Lmao Community" if they have 100% stock access. You also need a Discord bot application and token. Most easy way to use this code is to go to https://replit.com and make account. Then create a new file and copy and paste the code.

HOW TO USE | READ ABOVE BEFORE STARTING
1. Make a main.py and webserver.py file in Replit
2. Insert your token by going to the "Secrets" tab in the left on Replit
3. Name the key "Token" and put your bot token in the value.
4. Download the "discord-components" package by running "pip install discord-components" in the shell
5. Press the "RUN" button

If the code doesn't work DM me on Discord at Nedia#9511.
